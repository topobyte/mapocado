# About

Mapocado is project that defines a binary vector map database file format
and provides libraries and tools for rendering map tiles based on such
map files.

Mapocado is designed to work well for OpenStreetMap data, but is not
necessarily limited to this source of data.
It's map files are designed for efficient read-only access on both mobile
devices as well as desktop and server applications.

There currently are rendering engines for Android and Swing.

It integrates well with Jeography and Nomioc.
