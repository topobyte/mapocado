/**
 * The OverlayActivationManager is an object that implements the
 * MapWindowChangeListener interface and may thus be added to a Viewer's
 * MapWindow instance. The object will deactivate the specified nodePainter as
 * soon as the mapWindows' properties change. After the delay, specified with
 * the timeout parameter, elapsed the nodePainter will be activated again and a
 * repaint of the viewer will be scheduled. If subsequent changes to the
 * mapWindow happen during the delay phase, the reactivation will be scheduled
 * to happen accordingly later such that the delay will be honored for the last
 * change that occurred after all.
